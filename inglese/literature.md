# The Romantic Era
It develops from 1776 (year of the American Revolution) to 1837.

## American Revolution
Britain posessed 13 colonies in the US and started to tax them and they had no representation in the Parliament. So the colonies refused to pay the taxes and rebelled, backed by the French they managed to defeat the british army. 
Thomas Jefferson drew up the Declaration of Independence, which declares some fundamental rights of all men:
- all men are equal
- all men must have the same rights
- everybody has the right to pursue happiness

## French Revolution
The French revolution came as a shock to Britain, because it subverted the established order.  During the French Revolution Britain led a very important role: head of the coalition that fought Napoleon. Britain won many battles thanks to the navy lead by Horace Nelson.

*Aftermath = in the wake of*

## Industrial Revolution
The first meeting of workers started taking place after the French Revolution, they rebeled against factories. The key year 1811, when Luddite riots broke out, those were eventually suppresed. 

The industrial revolution brought many social changes. It occurred thanks to development of technology. Major factors were new materials (iron and steel), new energy sources (coal, steam engine) and new machines. Those last ones reduced the need for workers.

People moved from villages to cities. Work conditions were apalling (very bad), workers were paid little and had little food and worn clothes. Children were exploited in mines, because they were small. 

In 1824 the first Trade Unions were founded, at first they fought for the rights of the children. Many social reformes were passed, the most immportant one is the Reform Bill (1821), it consist fo 3 different acts:
- the Factory Act
- the abolishion of slavery
- it extended the power to vote

*Apalling = very bad*

## Romantic Revolution
It concerns the fields of arts and literature. It rounds on the concept of the sublime: feeling the greatness of nature and the insignificance of man.

The Sublime is against the neoclassical ideas (regularity, harmony, proportion, …). The authors that dealt with the Sublime chose scenes where dreadful elements are present.

In this period the Gothic literary current develops, it’s main representative is The Castle of Otranto by Horace Walpole, set in medieval Italy and the topic (as in every novel of the romantic age) is a girl persecuted by a villain.

Romatic literature strives for the freedom of expression of the self.

Key characteristics of the romantics
- Importance of the feelings, instinct, intuition
- imagination, which allows us a clearer interpretation of reality
- passionate description of the natural landscape, often very detailed
- some authors deal with the visible, some other authors deal with unordinary situations and explore the extraordinary
- the stress on individualism, predilection for first person narration, the author doesn’t want to feel part of society and prefers isolation in nature
- the **search for infinity**, they strives to reach a different kind of dimensions, the poet is seen 
- as a prophet-like figure

There are 2 generations of romantic poets

## First Generation
The first romantic poet was William Blake (he was also a painter and engraver).
Then came William Wordsworth, who deals with the visible world, he presents men in the middle of nature and the emotions that arise.

The other main figure is Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Wordsworth and Coleridge cannot be considered in separation, because they wrote together the Lyrical Ballads, that marks the start of the english romantic era. The preface is considered the manifesto of the stream.

The subjects of the poem are very uncanny creatures.

### William Blake
He was self-taught poet. He wrote 2 collection of poets: Songs of Innocence (1789) and Songs of Experience (1794). The first contains mostly happy cheerful poems set  in nature and that star children. In the latter he presents also the negative sides of mankind.
He was born in a poor family, attended a drawing school and then became an engraver. All the poems in the Songs of Innocence are accompanied by an engraving.

He was in favour of the revolutions, both american and french, he attacked the church of england and the monarchy.

He makes wide use of anglosaxon words (instead of french). His style is rich in symbols.

In the his 2 collections he presents 2 different, contrasting dimensions:
- the World of Innocence, characterizes by his happiness, it's like a garden of Eden, children are the protagonists. It's a naive world
- the World of Experience, chatracterized by violence and social injustice, the main symbol is the tiger, seen as a spooky and uncanny creature.

The 2 states coexist and we must keep them in the right balance, because in humankind there is both good and evil

Imagination enables men to see beyond the phisical reality.

He was deemed the poet of the children, because his poems are very simple and often star children. Also he publically set himself against children exploitaition in mines and by their families themselves.

#### The Lamb
The speaker is a child and the ardesee is a lamb. *He* is  Christ. The child is wondering who created the lamb, the answer is found in the second stanza: Christ.

There is a grass field (*mead* = meadow)
The lamb is described as having a soft and bright fur, a tender voice

The ryme scheme is composed of rhyming couplets

The Lamb is has a whooly and bright fur.
The poet and the Lamb are the same, because the poet is a boy and so is the Lamb. Childhood is an important theme for the Romantics, because it's spontaneous.

Christ refers to himself as a Lamb. The 3 subjects of the poem in the end are only 1

#### The Tyger
There is a clear connection witht the poem "The Lamb": "did he who made the lamb make thee".
The only difference between he first and the last stanza is the change from "could" to "dare", meaning the opinion of the poet: the one who createdthe tiger "dared" to do that.

## Second Generation
It starts with Lord Byron, he writes adventurous stories, his main character is a hero that rebels against social hypocrisy.

Shelly was a friend of Byron and the both of them lived in exile, they liked the ideals of the french revolution. His wife wrote Frankenstein, her novel is deemed a novel of purpose, because there is a purpose behind her writing. She talks about the negative applications of technology and science on real life.

Then we have Keats, Edgar Allan Poe (he deals with terror and mystery and the tirumph of irrationality) and (author of Ivano).

### Jane Austin
She is one of the most important English novelist. Her most important work is Pride and Prejudice. She sets her novels in the provincial middle class England, the plots are centered on love stories and is very skilled in portraiting female character.
Her novels are called novels of manner, because her characters are usually well-mannered.

### Wordsworth
Inspiration from nature. Attended college in Cambridge Did a walking tour through Europe.
Supported the French Revolution. He couldn't make a living out of his writing

He met Coleridge, the father of English Romanticism. With him he wrote the Lyrical Ballads.

He was appointed poet-lauret after death.

Children are the best example of communion with nature, because they are fundamentally good. He thinks of himself as a man speaking to men.

All these points are contained in the English manifesto.
Wordsworth expresses his feelings in a spontaneous, but objective and rational way.
