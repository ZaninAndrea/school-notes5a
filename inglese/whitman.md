# Walt Whitman
## Life
Walt Whitman was born in New York in 1819 from a poor family. He had little education and started working at an early age.

In the 1840s and 1850s ==he travelled throughout the USA==, getting to know its people, that will be the subject of his poetry.
The Civil War was a shock for him.

He died in 1892 after revising his poems.

## Leaves of Grass
The only work of Whitman is _Leaves of Grass_, he first published it in 1855, but ==kept revising and adding poems== for all his life.
The fame of the collection kept growing steadily.

The theme of the collection is **America and its people**, his poetry reflects his philosophy of inspired individualism and the **glorification of the self**.

He sees himself as the incarnation of the country's spirit and geography.

He used the **free verse**, that he invented, to reflect the rythm of the ordinary language.
==His language is simple== yet passionate, sometimes colloquial; he widely used metaphors and similes.

# The Modernist Revolution
## The loss of certainty
At the beggining of th 20th century **skepticism** started to emerge among intellectuals.

Nietzsche's moral relativism and Einstein's relativity destroyed the vision of the worlds as certain and understandable.

Freud's discovery of the unconscious gave intellectuals something to hold on, because it meant that consciously or unconsciously human behaviour followed a pattern.
