# Wordsworth and Coleridge
## Wordsworth
### Life
William Wordsworth was born in 1770 in Cockermouth, in the Lake District. In his childhood **he could wander in nature and this provided the inspiration for his poems in the future**.
He graduated at Cambridge in 1791 and then left England for a walking tour of France and the Alps.

In France **he became a passionate revolutionary and had a baby with a french girl** (Annette Vallon), he then had to abadon both France and Annette and go back to England due to lack of money. Guilt and divded political loyalties brought him to the edge of a nervous breakdown.

He went to live in Dorset with his sister Dorothy and **in 1797 met Coleridge**. The friendship between the 2 poets resulted in the Lyrical Ballads (1798).

### Poetry
Coleridge, together with Blake, was the **first poet to have children as subjects**. He thought that children in their simplicity and goodness were **closer to harmony with nature** than adults.
He wrote several poems about children's feelings in the lyrical Ballads. He then went on to think that the soul after the birth gradually loses its perfect knowledge and memory of the perfect union with the universe.
In 1805 his creative power started to decline, nonetheless after his death in 1850 *The Prelude* was published and it's considered to be his masterpiece, together iwth the Lyrical Ballads.

### Lyrical Ballads (1798)
**Wordsworth and Coleridge divided the task** of writing this collection of poems: Wordsworth contributed poems on common eevents written in simple language, while Coleridge wrote about exotic places.
**The volume marked the appance of modern poetry**.
The 1800 edition contained the *Preface* by Wordsworth, that is considered the Manifesto of the English Romanticism. the poet expresses his major ideas:
- choosing ordinary subjects and language as a way to making poetry mroe accessible
- the poet is **a man speaking to men**
- **poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions**

Most of Wordsworth's poems in the Lyrical Ballads deal with nature:
- **nature as the countryside**: mountain, rivers, lakes, woods, ... the scene is silent but not desolate, it is a source of great pleasure for man.
- **nature as a source of inspiration**: Part of Wordsworth's novelty was the way he depicts the relationship between man and nature. **Men are part of nature**, our best feeling come from nature.
- **nature as a life force**: Although Wordsworth did not like this interpretation, one would be excused for thinking that there is a pantheistic view in his poems, because man seem to communicate with nature in a literal sense.

Wordsworth emphatizes the importance of the ordinary man and the fact that a country man can teach lessons the wisest philosopher cannot.
