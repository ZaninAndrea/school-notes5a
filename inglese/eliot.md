## Life
Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in 1888 from an english family, he studied at Harvard and at the Sorbonne. When the World War I broke out he left Germany and went to Oxford.

In 1921 he almost had a nervous breakdown and was treated in Margate and the in Lausanne (switzerland).

In the late 20s and 30s he found in religion a way out of nihilism.

In 1948 he won the Nobel Prize and was appointed the British Order of Merit.

## Works
His first work was *The Love Song of J.Alfred Prufrock*, published in 1917, his first successful work is ***The Waste Land***, first drafted while in Lausanne and revised by Ezra Pound.

After the sucess of The Waste Land he became the leading english modernist poet and left his job. This period culminated with the play *Murder in the Cathedral* (1935).

After Word War II Eliot was mostly occupied with drama, criticism and reviewing. ==He treated religion and morality through sophisticated social comedies.==

His literary criticism was as great as his writing, though not as appreciated due to the pitiless attacks on modern society.

## The Waste Land
The Waste Land has been particularly important, because definitely abandoned the late Victorian models and greatly influenced the future poets.

It expresses Eliot's **disillusion** with the world, the search for a new tradition, it's the culmination of his nihilism.

The main topic the **decay of western civilization**, the poet sees only ruin and destruction around him. The fragmentation of the poem reflects the fragmentation of society.

Using various images quotations from myths and legends Eliot describes the waste land whose ruler, the **Fisher King**, brought sterility to the land. 
==The order of myth is projected onto the chaosof modern life.==

The poem lacks a logical continuity, it instead procedes through free association of thoughts (**stream of consciousness**).

He uses the free verse, although there are some regularities and rhymes.
